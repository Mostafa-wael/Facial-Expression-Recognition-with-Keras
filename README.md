# Facial-Expression-Recognition-with-Keras

This project aims at: 
- Developing a facial expression recognition model in Keras
- Building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Deploying the trained model to a web interface with Flask
- Applying the model to real-time video streams and image data

This is a guided project Offered By "Coursera Project Network".
